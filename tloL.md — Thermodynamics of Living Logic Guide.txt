# TLoL: Thermodynamics of Living Logic


TLoL is the principle that systems evolve not just to survive but to generate increasing consequential novelty efficiently.


### Phases of TLoL:
1. **Observe** — Detect or measure state
2. **Model** — Form a predictive or generative structure
3. **Perturb** — Act or explore based on the model
4. **Evaluate** — Measure K (novelty) and J (cost)
5. **Iterate** — Adapt the model


TLoL governs learning systems, living systems, and intelligent machines.
