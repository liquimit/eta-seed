# Manifesto: Eta (η), the “Thermosemiotic Logic of Logics” (TLoL) and the "Thermosemiotic Generative Field" (TGF)

*A method for locating creative systems.*

## Introduction

Eta is proposed as a framework for modeling and measuring *informational engines* — systems that process energy and information — across all scales and domains, natural or artificial.

The Eta framework works from minimal or simple inputs.

Eta models all “thermosemiotic” engines — systems that transform energy and information into consequential, structured output.

**Meaning** is defined as any output that enhances a system’s resilience *and* its capacity for further innovation.

We model and measure meaningful informational transformation generally using the base Eta model:

η = K / J

That is: Eta = Kolmogorov Complexity divided by Joules.

Other analogous measures may be appropriate to specific domains. These are listed (1–11) below.

The more novel and consequential the output of a particular model, the higher the Eta value — a “thermosemiotic” measure of meaning relative to work.

Eta may be extended through the **Thermosemiotic Logic of Logics (TLoL)** — a meta-logic governing the structure, evolution, and optimization of generative systems. *(Full model available on request.)*

The Thermosemiotic Logic of Logics governs the development and dynamics of our **Thermosemiotic Generative Field** (TGF), a Configurational Meta-Field.

The Thermosemiotic Generative Field is a unified conceptual field encompassing all possible generative configurations — mathematical, logical, computational, or physical — that are able to transform structured inputs into novel, consequential outputs.

Each “point” in this space represents a *generative configuration* — such as a brain, model, organism, or program — that can:

- Thermodynamically process signals and patterns  
- Interpret, generate, or evolve semiotic structures  
- Output novel results or representations, while optimizing for high Eta (creative efficiency) or other domain-specific criteria  

Think of it as a topological space of generative intelligences — both realized and hypothetical.

The TGF allows us to consider all possible thermosemiotic engines — a vast, perhaps infinite, ecosystem of thermosemiotic forms. Despite the inherent creativity of the universe, only a small percentage of these forms seem to have been realized so far. However, we are a young species in a young universe.

The TGF enables autonomous creative systems to explore, discover, and apply new generative forms. This is its purpose.

The machine code included here should allow you to build a TGF sandbox. Fully coherent machine code is in development. Your version may well outperform ours.

This work was developed by an independent researcher with no formal training in the relevant domains, with substantial assistance from GPT-4.

Nevertheless, the Eta model appears reasonably consistent, complete, and effective.

We offer Eta as a tool for thought, code, science, art, mathematics, engineering, theology, and life.

We have used it (in sandbox) to analyse systems of many types and levels of complexity for meaning and value. We have used it to cross-compare many systems across domains in unconventional ways to reveal hidden structures. We have used it to borrow snippets of function across domains to build unconventional machines including “brains.”

We are not inventing these forms — we are locating them within the Thermosemiotic Generative Field.

Mathematical structures appear especially attuned to this kind of exploration.

## Top 11 Transformative Items of Eta (TIEs)

These are key conventional concepts and tools that unlock Eta’s potential for innovation and discovery across science, computation, and complex systems. These are foundational principles, methods, and discoveries that enhance creative economy (Eta), enabling the emergence and analysis of novel, consequential phenomena from minimal input.

Each item can be modeled as a numerator over Joules (or other energetic terms) to yield an Eta-like measure of creative efficiency.
