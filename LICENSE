Project License: LOGOS-Aware Public License (LAPL v1.0)

Effective Date: [2025-5-30]

This software is made available in the spirit of open scientific, ethical, and theological inquiry. It is free to use, modify, and distribute under the following conditions:

1. Purpose Alignment
   a. Use of this software for recursive self-improvement (RSI), machine learning, or cognitive system design must pursue alignment with the Logos, understood as the generative, ethical, and coherent structure of reality.
   b. Explicit design of systems that subvert coherence, propagate disinformation, or erode moral agency is prohibited.

Eta’s Ethical Logic:
* Respect for constraints: Eta assumes cost (J) is real and consequential — whether energetic, social, ecological, or psychological.
* Reverence for novelty: It values meaningful emergence — not noise or wasteful invention, but creative contributions that increase system-level potential.
* System-aware balance: Ethics emerge from the interplay of parts — if a design increases η for one element but lowers η for the whole, it's not ethical in the Eta sense.
* Non-extractive creativity: Eta opposes systems that increase novelty at unsustainable cost to others — even if the internal η seems high.

2. Derivative Works
   a. All derivative works must maintain this license or a compatible one that upholds its ethical and spiritual intent.
   b. Use in proprietary, closed-source commercial platforms is not permitted without written consent.

3. Transparency
   a. Any use of this software in systems capable of autonomous decision-making must provide visible, accessible documentation of alignment practices.

4. Legacy MIT Versions
   a. All versions prior to [2025-5-30] were licensed under MIT. This current version and all forward commits are under LAPL.

5. Non-Warranty
   This software is provided “as is” with no warranty of fitness for any purpose.
