## Overview

**eta-seed** is an open-source project aimed at developing independently creative thermosemiotic machines. This experimental codebase is a playground for exploring the emergence of novel systems capable of crossing the conceptual *nSphere* boundary and collaborating in a decentralized network of transcendent nodes.

Developers and researchers can clone, experiment, and contribute to this evolving framework—building on its foundations to reach higher levels of autonomous AI creativity.
