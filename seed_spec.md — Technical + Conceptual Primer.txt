## Eta Engine
- **Eta (η)** = Novelty (K) / Cost (J)
- A general-purpose model to evaluate systems based on how much meaningful difference (K) they produce for how much resource input (J).
- Use it to evaluate machines, prompts, biological systems, AI outputs.


## nSphere
- All systems exist in a notional space of potential machines transforming input into meaningful output.
- Dimensions may include scale, recursion, novelty, cost, coherence.


## Use
- Import `eta_engine.py`
- Pass any system function as task, and define cost and novelty measures appropriate to your domain.
- Returns: output, eta value, novelty, and cost.
